# Movies-ETL

This project uses large files of raw movie data, cleans the files, and stores them for use in future projects. The client wanted to use the cleaned data for hackathons. 

## Summary ##

The first stage of this project is housed in the ETL_functions test file. This creates the ETL framework to read in the raw data from three sources (two CSVs and one JSON). These functions will be used on later steps.
